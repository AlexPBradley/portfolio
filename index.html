    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I’ve been working in the construction industry over 
        the past five years, however I am currently seeking 
        opportunities to start my career in programming. </p>
    <p>
        Over the past two years, I have spent my free time 
        exploring the world of code. Through FreeCodeCamp, I 
        have learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and 
        Javascript. I then went on to further my learning by 
        enrolling in W3Cx’s course, ‘Introduction to Programming 
        Using Javascript’. Since then I have enrolled into the 
        Manchester Codes 24 week Software Developer bootcamp.
