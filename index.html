            <h3>About Me</h3>
        </section>

        <p>I’ve been working in the construction industry over 
            the past five years, however I am currently seeking 
            opportunities to start my career in programming. </p>
        <p>
            Over the past two years, I have spent my free time 
            exploring the world of code. Through FreeCodeCamp, I 
            have learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and 
            Javascript. I then went on to further my learning by 
            enrolling in W3Cx’s course, ‘Introduction to Programming 
            Using Javascript’. Since then I have enrolled into the 
            Manchester Codes 24 week Software Developer bootcamp.
